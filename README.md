# Benchmarking Study

This repository contains code for benchmarking power consumption of sorting algorithms (Quick Sort and Fibonacci) in different programming languages: Python, Java, and Rust.

## Files
- `python/quick_sort.py`: Python code for Quick Sort benchmark.
- `java/QuickSort.java`: Java code for Quick Sort benchmark.
- `rust/quick_sort.rs`: Rust code for Quick Sort benchmark.

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/benchmarking-study.git`
2. Navigate to the appropriate directory for the programming language.
3. Run the script according to the instructions for each language.

## Results
- The benchmarking results show the power consumption of each language while running Quick Sort and Fibonacci algorithms.
